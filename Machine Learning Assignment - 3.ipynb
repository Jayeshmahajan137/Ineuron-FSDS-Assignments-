    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is not capable of solving all problems there are a few tasks which ML fails to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reasoning Power:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One area where ML has not mastered successfully is reasoning power, a distinctly human trait. Algorithms available today are mainly oriented towards specific use-cases and are narrowed down when it comes to applicability. They cannot think as to why a particular method is happening that way or ‘introspect’ their own outcomes.For instance, if an image recognition algorithm identifies apples and oranges in a given scenario, it cannot say if the apple (or orange) has gone bad or not, or why is that fruit an apple or orange. Mathematically, all of this learning process can be explained by us, but from an algorithmic perspective, the innate property cannot be told by the algorithms or even us.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, ML algorithms lack the ability to reason beyond their intended application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contextual Limitation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the area of natural language processing (NLP), text and speech information are the means to understand languages by NLP algorithms. They may learn letters, words, sentences or even the syntax, but where they fall back is the context of the language. Algorithms do not understand the context of the language used. A classic example for this would be the “Chinese room” argument given by philosopher John Searle, which says that computer programs or algorithms grasp the idea merely by ‘symbols’ rather than the context given. (You can find the complete information on Chinese room here).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ML does not have an overall idea of the situation. It is limited by mnemonic interpretations rather than thinking to see what is actually going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we see ML implementations being deployed on a significant basis, it all depends on data as well as its scalability. Data is growing at an enormous rate and has many forms which largely affects the scalability of an ML project. Algorithms cannot do much about this unless they are updated constantly for new changes to handle data. This is where ML regularly requires human intervention in terms of scalability and remains unsolved mostly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, growing data has to be dealt the right way if shared on an ML platform which again needs examination through knowledge and intuition apparently lacked by current ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Regulatory Restriction For Data In ML:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ML usually need considerable amounts (in fact, massive) of data in stages such as training, cross-validation etc. Sometimes, data includes private as well as general information. This is where it gets complicated. Most tech companies have privatised data and these data are the ones which are actually useful for ML applications. But, there comes the risk of the wrong usage of data, especially in critical areas such as medical research, health insurance etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though data are anonymised at times, it has the possibility of being vulnerable. Hence this is the reason regulatory rules are imposed heavily when it comes to using private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Internal Working Of Deep Learning:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sub-field of ML is actually responsible for today’s AI growth. What was once just a theory has appeared to be the most powerful aspect of ML. Deep Learning (DL) now powers applications such as voice recognition, image recognition and so on through artificial neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the internal working of DL is still unknown and yet to be solved. Advanced DL algorithms still baffle researchers in terms of its working and efficiency. Millions of neurons that form the neural networks in DL increase abstraction at every level, which cannot be comprehended at all. This is why deep learning is dubbed a ‘black box’ since its internal agenda is unknown.\n",

    "Ans:- \n",
    "* What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why is machine learning important?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations.

The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning: In this type of machine learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and the output of the algorithm is specified.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning: This type of machine learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. The algorithm scans through data sets looking for any meaningful connection. The data that algorithms train on as well as the predictions or recommendations they output are predetermined.\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning: This approach to machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types. Data scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data on its own and develop its own understanding of the data set.\n",
    "Reinforcement learning: Data scientists typically use reinforcement learning to teach a machine to complete a multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules. Data scientists program an algorithm to complete a task and give it positive or negative cues as it works out how to complete a task. But for the most part, the algorithm decides on its own what steps to take along the way.\n",
