    "# Q2 - What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The term “machine learning” has been inspired by the organic nature of continuous improvement in human learning. The       process of human learning builds upon pre-existing knowledge, where the knowledge is either modified or reinforced to       make it more accurate, and subsequently used to improve decision making and problem solving.\n",
    "      Human learning and their equivalents are as explained below :- \n",
    "      \n",
    "1. Supervised Learning- \n",
    "in supervised learning, a computer program is given a training dataset that is labelled with corresponding output values, and a function will be determined based on this dataset. This function, or algorithm, will then be used for classifying new data to predict their corresponding output values, with the assumption that the new data conforms to the rules of the function being used. Linear regression, decision trees, random forest and support vector machines are some commonly used techniques that are actually examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human Learning Theory Equivalent-\n",
    "Artificial neural networks follow the neuronal principle of Hebbian learning, where the algorithm centres on inputs with similar properties, just like how neurons that activate simultaneously strengthen the synaptic link between each other\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, there are “correct answers” but the input data is not paired with the desired outputs. The “correct answers” contain numerical rewards, which the algorithm needs to maximise by choosing the correct actions to take. This is very much similar to a mouse navigating through a maze looking for food, where wrong moves result in the punishment of hunger, and right moves get it to the food more quickly.\n",
    "Essentially, reinforcement learning is figuring out the right balance between exploration and exploitation, where exploitation gives certainty in the amount of reward, but exploration opens the possibility of finding higher rewards, or risks getting no reward at all. The successful development of artificial intelligence for abstract games such as checkers and Go was based on the concept of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human Learning Theory Equivalent-\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is inspired by the reward system of operant conditioning. Operant conditioning was established by B. F. Skinner,after Edward Thorndike  observed how cats learn to escape a puzzle box more quickly after a repeated number of trials. Thorndike noted that behaviours that helped the cats to escape were repeated more frequently over time compared to behaviours that did not, and he termed this the law of effect.\n",
    "Skinner similarly created a chamber for rats and pigeons, where one lever delivered a reward while another administered a shock. He found that when the animals started to identify what each lever did, pressing of the reward lever was reinforced and frequency of the behaviour increased. Conversely, punishment resulted in decrease of the shock lever being pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the training dataset does not have any labelled corresponding output values. Since there are no “correct answers” to learn from, the objective of the algorithm is to uncover any interesting patterns that it can find in the data, and new data will help to confirm or disconfirm these patterns that it finds. Some of the well-known examples of unsupervised learning include k-means clustering, principal component analysis and artificial neural networks.\n",

The type of training data input does impact the algorithm, and that concept will be covered further momentarily. \n",
    "New input data is fed into the machine learning algorithm to test whether the algorithm works correctly. The prediction and results are then checked against each other.\n",

It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. \n",

The goal of the robot is to get the reward that is the diamond and avoid the hurdles that are fired. The robot learns by trying all the possible paths and then choosing the path which gives him the reward with the least hurdles.
